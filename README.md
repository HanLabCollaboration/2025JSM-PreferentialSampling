# JSM 2025 Topic Contributed Session: Preferential Sampling in Environmental Exposures and Its Impact on Inference with Implications in Environment and Health Policy

## Estimating the impact of ambient air pollution on overall mortality in the presence of preferential sampling and measurement error using electronic health record data

This repository consists of three html files:
1. [Data processing](R/1_JSM2025-PreferentialSampling-Data.html).
2. [Examining the presence of preferential sampling in Northern California using a joint model of the observation process and site-selection process](R/2_JSM2025-PreferentialSampling-AirPollutionModeling.html).
3. [Investigating the impact of preferential sampling and measurement error in a case study]().

Slides can be found here (will be uploaded after JSM).

The codes are based on the tutorial developed by [Jones et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10006).
